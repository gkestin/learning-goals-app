# Learning Goals File Recovery System

## Overview

This directory contains all the scripts and documentation for the Learning Goals file recovery process. The system was designed to recover files that were accidentally deleted from Firebase Storage while preserving the database references.

## üéØ **MISSION ACCOMPLISHED: 90.9% Recovery Success**

- **‚úÖ 628 files successfully recovered and uploaded** (90.9% of total)
- **‚è∞ 12 files failed due to upload timeouts** (1.7% of total)  
- **‚ùå 51 files not found in recovery folder** (7.4% of total)
- **üìä Total database references: 691 files**

---

## üìÅ File Structure

### Analysis Scripts
- `analyze_database_files.py` - Initial analysis of database file references
- `analyze_missing_files.py` - Detailed analysis of missing files  
- `improved_matching_analysis.py` - Advanced file matching with multiple strategies
- `cornell_specific_matching.py` - Cornell-specific file naming pattern matching
- `cornell_corrected_matching.py` - Refined Cornell matching (legitimate matches only)

### Recovery Scripts
- `final_file_recovery.py` - **Main recovery script** - uploaded 628 files successfully
- `file_recovery_script.py` - Earlier version of recovery script
- `retry_failed_uploads.py` - Comprehensive retry script for failed uploads
- `quick_retry.py` - Quick retry for specific timeout failures

---

## üîç **What We Discovered**

### Initial Problem
- 691 file references existed in Firestore database
- Actual files were missing from Firebase Storage
- Recovery folder contained 5,408 files in various formats (PDF, DOCX, PPTX)

### File Naming Challenges
- **PDF files**: Database referenced original names
- **Word files**: Database referenced as `filename.docx.pdf`
- **PowerPoint files**: Database referenced as `filename.pptx.pdf`
- **Cornell files**: Had complex path-based naming variations

### Matching Strategies Developed
1. **Exact filename matching** - 457 matches
2. **Cornell legitimate matching** - 43 matches (path corrections)
3. **Partial matching with correct extensions** - 107 matches
4. **Base name matching** - 12 matches
5. **Fuzzy matching** - Various confidence levels
6. **Super fuzzy matching** - 15 matches

## üöÄ **Recovery Process**

### Phase 1: Analysis (analyze_database_files.py)
- Found 691 file references in database
- Recovery folder contained 5,408 files total
- Initial basic matching: 429 matches (62% success rate)

### Phase 2: Advanced Matching (improved_matching_analysis.py)
- Implemented multiple matching strategies
- Achieved 597 matches (86.4% success rate)
- Identified 73 files needing Word/PowerPoint conversion

### Phase 3: Cornell-Specific Analysis
- **cornell_specific_matching.py**: Found all 87 missing Cornell files
- **cornell_corrected_matching.py**: Refined to legitimate matches only
- Avoided inappropriate worksheet‚Üíslides transformations

### Phase 4: File Recovery (final_file_recovery.py)
- **628 files successfully uploaded** (90.9% success rate)
- **72 files converted** from Word/PowerPoint to PDF
- **Preview URLs generated** for all uploaded files
- **Firebase Storage integration** fully functional

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Outstanding Issues**

### 1. Upload Timeout Failures (12 files)
Files that consistently timeout during upload:
- `Lec1A_post_class.pdf` (JCz - UCLA)
- `Lecture12.pdf` (Marty Weissman)
- `Lec9B_post_class.pdf` (JCz - UCLA)
- ~9 additional files from main upload process

**Potential Solutions:**
- Upload during off-peak hours
- Check file sizes (may be very large)
- Use Firebase Console manual upload
- Adjust upload timeout settings

### 2. Unmatched Files (51 files)

#### Cornell Files (47 files)
Mostly worksheets and quizzes that may not exist in recovery folder:
- 37 worksheet files (e.g., `Class 26 - Review-class26_worksheet.pdf`)
- 5 quiz files (e.g., `Week 2 - 1.4-quiz1.pdf`)
- 3 reading guide files  
- 2 worksheet solution files

#### Other Creators (4 files)
- 2 Martin Weissman final exams
- 3 Deb Hughes Hallet PowerPoint files
- 1 Sindura Kularajan PowerPoint file

**Potential Solutions:**
- Manual search in recovery folder with different naming patterns
- Contact original creators for missing files
- Accept that some files may be permanently lost

## üõ† **How to Use These Scripts**

### Prerequisites
```bash
# Install LibreOffice for Word/PowerPoint conversion
brew install --cask libreoffice

# Set environment variables
export FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET="learninggoals2.firebasestorage.app"
export USE_MOCK_SERVICES="False"
export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="path/to/credentials.json"
```

### Running the Scripts

#### To analyze current status:
```bash
python3 improved_matching_analysis.py
```

#### To retry failed uploads:
```bash
python3 retry_failed_uploads.py
```

#### To quick retry specific timeouts:
```bash
python3 quick_retry.py
```

#### To run full recovery (if needed):
```bash
python3 final_file_recovery.py
```

## üìù **Next Steps (Optional)**

1. **Address timeout files**: Retry uploads during better network conditions
2. **Manual search**: Look for unmatched files with different naming patterns
3. **Contact creators**: Reach out for any critical missing files
4. **System monitoring**: Ensure ongoing file accessibility
5. **Backup strategy**: Implement regular backups to prevent future loss

## üîß **Technical Notes**

### Firebase Configuration
- Bucket: `learninggoals2.firebasestorage.app`
- Storage path format: `pdfs/{creator}_{filename}_{clean_filename}`
- Preview URL format: `https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/{bucket}/o/{encoded_path}?alt=media`

### File Processing
- **LibreOffice** used for Word/PowerPoint ‚Üí PDF conversion
- **Timeout handling** with 3 retry attempts and 5-second delays
- **Progress tracking** with detailed console output
- **Error logging** for failed operations

### Database Integration
- **Firestore collections**: `documents`
- **File metadata preserved**: creator, course_name, institution, learning_goals
- **Storage paths maintained** for existing references
